# Sync â€“ Simple Backup Utility
Simple macOS tray application to syncronize a folder using `rsync`.

This might not be the most elegant way to backup files, but it's simple and it works.

Using a simple bash script, this swift application simply provides an interface to controll `sync_files.sh`


## Setup
You need the latest Xcode to configure `sync` for your system. There is no ready-to-use binary yet.

Import the project and change these lines in `StatusMenuController.swift`:
```Swift
task.arguments?.append("[SOURCE]")
task.arguments?.append("[DEST]")

// e.g. copy files from 'foo/bar' to '/Volumes/usb/foo/bar':
// task.arguments?.append("foo/bar")
// task.arguments?.append("/Volumes/usb/foo/bar")
```

You might want to change the text for the menu items in the `MainMenu.xib` file and add more items.
